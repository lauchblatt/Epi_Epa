# Epi_Epa

Work-in-progress repository to store data und research outputs for the research project EpiEpa (<a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539293243">From Epistemic Injustice to Epistemic Awareness</a>), an interdisciplinary research project between catholic theology and computer science. More information: <a href="https://missbrauchsmuster.de/forschen/projekte/forschungsprojekt-von-epistemic-injustice-zu-epistemic-awareness-prozessbasierte-methodenforschung-zu-missbrauch-an-erwachsenen-frauen-in-der-katholischen-kirche/">here</a>. 

Right now, this repository contains texts, annotations, tables and visualisations of our first pilot annotation of five five abuse reports by catholic institutions. The current data is only for review purposes of paper contributions. Please do not share the data or research outputs.

The repository is currently structured as follows:

* tagset: the entire tagset as structured CATMA table
* text_sources: The original PDFs and txt-files of the reports
* distributions (pie charts of annotation distributions)
* catma_outputs (raw output and processed output tables jsons of the CATMA annotations)
* term_frequencies (term frequency tables and word clouds)
* text_lengths (length analysis of annotations)

Please note that for all analysis, we differ between first level which is the first hierarchical level of our annotation scheme and tag or tag type which is the lowest hierarchical level.
